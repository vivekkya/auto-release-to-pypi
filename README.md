### Step 1: Add required files

  Pypi requires following files to build a package
  - setup.py
  - setup.cfg
  - README.md

  Create a new file `.github\workflows\publish-to-pypi.yml` and copy paste below content.

  ```yaml
  name: Upload Python Package

  on:
    release:
      types: [created]

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install setuptools wheel twine
      - name: Build and publish
        env:
          TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }}
          TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
        run: |
          python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
          twine upload dist/*
  ```

### Step 3: Create package release

After files are inplace and pypi credentials has been updated in github repo secrets, next step is to create a release tag in the repo, which will trigger github actions to run workflow defined in `.github\workflows\publish-to-pypi.yml`, leading to deployment of package in pypi.

4. **Install updated package** : Run below pip command to install package.
  
  ```
  pip install packagename==version
  ```
